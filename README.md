Fantom Marketplace
Welcome to the Fantom Marketplace project, a solution for buying and selling physical goods with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as proof of purchase, secured by smart contracts. This project was created for the Fantom Q1 2023 hackathon.

The problem 
There is no protocol at the moment that is designed to be used for buying and selling strictly physical goods with ease. 

The solution

As a buyer fantom marketplace enables you to check your shipping status in real time on-chain, the receipt is a NFT with all the necessary data : 
-Price that you paid
-Who sold the item
-The token ID of the item you bought 
-Shipping Status. 

As a seller Fantom Marketplace provides a decentralized way to list goods for sale.
Upload a photo of the product to IPFS then create a NFT with all of your desired details:
-Sale price 
-Title
-Description
-Image
Fantom Marketplace also provides the ability to instantly withdraw your earned funds and update shipping status directly from your dashboard !
